Contribution Guidelines

## Commit Messages (for Internal AppNexus Contributors)

Prepend your commit message with the approrpiate JIRA ticket number: `CR-####: ...`.

## Merging Branches

Squashing commits is not mandatory, but can optionally be done to clean up Git history if your change is particularly large.

## Raising Github Issues 

If you are an external (non-AppNexus employee) contributor, feel free to create Github issuesâ€”the internal team will respond as soon as possible.
